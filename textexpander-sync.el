;;; Instructions:

;; 1) Assuming that you have TextExpander set up
;; 2) put this file and osx-plist.el in your lisp dir
;; 3) add to .emacs:
;;   (require 'textexpander-sync)
;; 4) sync (and resync) via: M-x textexpander-sync
;; 5) In TextExpander settings set "Expand In" to
;;    "all applications except" Emacs
;;
;; This code requires (osx-plist), which was probably included
;; If not, download it here:
;;   otherwise: http://edward.oconnor.cx/elisp/osx-plist.el
;;


;;; Code:

(require 'osx-plist)

(defvar textexpander-sync-file "~/Library/Application Support/TextExpander/Settings.textexpander"
  "Path to your TextExpander settings file.")

(defun textexpander-sync ()
  "Import TextExpander snippets."
  (interactive)
  (mapc (lambda (snippet)
          (define-abbrev global-abbrev-table (gethash "abbreviation" snippet) (gethash "plainText" snippet)))
        (gethash "snippetsTE2" (osx-plist-parse-file textexpander-sync-file))))

(provide 'textexpander-sync)
